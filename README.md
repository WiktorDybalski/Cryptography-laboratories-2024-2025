# Cryptography Laboratories 2024/2025

## Repository Description
This repository contains materials and implementations related to six cryptography laboratories for the 2024/2025 academic year. Each laboratory focuses on a different aspect of cryptography, covering both theoretical foundations and practical attacks as well as algorithm implementations.

## List of Laboratories

- **[Hash Functions](./Kryptografia_Ist_uproszczony_MD5.ipynb)**  
  Implementation and analysis of hash functions, their properties, and applications in cryptography.

- **[Hash Cryptanalysis and Dedicated Attacks](./kryptoanaliza_hashy.ipynb)**  
  Overview and practical execution of attacks on hash functions, such as collision attacks and birthday attacks.

- **[Discrete Logarithm Problem - Diffie-Hellman](./Diffie_Hellman.ipynb)**  
  Analysis of the discrete logarithm problem and its application in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol.

- **[Arithmetic in Galois Fields](./ciala_Galois_INF.ipynb)**  
  Introduction to arithmetic in finite fields and its application in cryptographic systems.

- **[Mini Project - Baby Kyber](./baby_kyber.ipynb)**  
  Implementation of a simplified version of the Kyber algorithm, used in post-quantum cryptography.
